## Cloudedge python opensource library

This is a reverse engine implementation of cloudedge360.com cameras, targeting
some ANRAN Wireless cameras and seeking an alternative engine for Cloudedge
Android app, exploiting his OpenResty implementation.

There is no documentation about this cameras, and like in the other manufacturer
(TAPO) I'm able to reengine his way to be controlled by user, and the posibility
to get it working in your server / home assistant without any other unknown user.

# Important notes

This cameras also has an unique manufacturer, but I saw searching that has the
same circuits than Iegeek and his famous BazzDoorBell, take a look at
https://github.com/guino/BazzDoorbell/

Some interesting documentation could be obtained from his reverse engine repo
supported by community at https://github.com/youribonnaffe/iegeek-security-camera
but his investigation & method requires direct access to the hardwdare,
including some tricks.
